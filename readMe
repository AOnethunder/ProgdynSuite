ProgdynSuite is a script set designed to facilitate the use of Gaussian 09, a program that provides electronic structure modeling.
This script set is designed only to run on BYU's Fulton Supercomputing System.
To install ProgdynSuite:
	put a copy of ProgdynSuite.zip in your $HOME directory
	if not already in your $HOME directory, type: cd $HOME
	type: unzip ProgdynSuite.zip
	type: ./InstallProgdyn.sh

Now ProgdynSuite is installed. In your $HOME directory you will have a single directory called 'ProgdynSuite'
This directory contains three sub-directories: 'ProgdynScripts', 'RunOutputs', and 'SubmitScripts'
'ProgdynScripts' contains all of the scripts/programs that ProgdynSuite needs to run
	- freqinHP and progdyn.conf need to be edited specifically for each run
		- freqinHP is set by running 'RunJob.sh' in the 'SubmitScripts' folder
		- progdyn.conf contains configuration options for running ProgdynSuite. They must be set specifically for the freqinHP file contents
'RunOutputs' contains the output of all of the runs of ProgdynSuite
	- Everytime a job is run, a temp directory is created that stores all the files needed for that run
	- When the job runs, the job itself creates an output file named out$SLURM_JOB_ID where $SLURM_JOB_ID is set by the supercomputer at run time
	- There is a script called 'RemoveEmptyTempFiles.sh' that deletes only the empty temp files
'SubmitScripts' contains the script that you run to start a ProgdynSuite job
	- To submit a job, change your current directory to the location of the .com file you wish to submit
	- Run the command RunJob.sh and the script will ask you, for each .com file in your current directory, if you would like to submit it
	- It will create a temp folder for each .com file that you submit
	- After running gaussian 09 on the .com file, it will check for normal termination
	- In the event of normal termination, it will then run Progdyn on the resulting .log file
	- This second submission will have a separate output file and temp file
